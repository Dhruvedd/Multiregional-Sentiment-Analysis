# Multiregional-Sentiment-Analysis
This is all the code we used to build the project for the RAISE - 25 Hackathon. Using a 10k dataset of AI-related news headlines. We have generated great insights, which are present in the presentation PDF in the repository

We augmented the original database to include a "country" column, we used a claude AI model to use the publisher information and assign a country of origin to wach news headline.

There is Sentiment Analysis based on catagories and countries. We used AFINN and NRC lexicon based models to do the sentiment analysis. Apart from that we also have a word cloud Thematic Analysis to see the common themes and words used in the headlines, by catagory and also by country. Furthermore, we have also analyzed publisher bias and average headline word count(also by catagory as well as country). Insights generated from these procedures are present in the presentation PDF.
